I sat alone on a summer evening in my wide-open cave of a room in a small floor-level rocking chair flipping through old forum posts on my 1st generation jailbroken iPad. It was likely thirty minutes until dinner meaning it was nearing an opportunity for me to share all the interesting but ultimately pointless tweaks and hacks I'd found online and through Cydia, the iOS jailbroken marketplace. I would mess with things like changing the system theme, getting retro game emulators, or even the most useless of all, changing things like the transparency of app icons. My family recognized the pointless endeavors of changing such minute details that no one really cares about, but to me, it felt awesome that I could play with the system in these ways and make it do anything I could find on Cydia, so long as it didn't crash of course.

During this time, Minecraft mania was also kicking into full-swing, and as my cringy old YouTube past reveals, I was one of the other millions of kids hooked on it.

Back then, Minecraft PE had no way to import custom maps on iOS. On Android, there was block launcher, and the users had much more control over the device's internal files, but you just couldn't do that on iOS. Through jailbreaking the device, there was a program called iFile that would like users access all of the device's files. This included downlaoding minecraft content and moving it ot the game's folders. With this, I was able to get maps, texture packs. and dive deep into other interesting things in the game's files. This really piqued my interest. I eagerly doug through every app I could find and just played with all the config files I could make sense of. I would change icons or rewrite text files, or just gaze in awe of the mysifying information of binary data that I didn't know how to begin to work with. One day, a friend of mine got me to play a Pokemon clone called Mino Monsters. You basically caught monsters, and could then train and battle them with friends. The app had a paid component where you could expidite training, but t never fealt worthwhile. My friend challanged me to battle him, but I was whoefully unprepaired and din't want to spend loads of time  grinding against level 3 peasents. I specifically remember going through all the files I could find in the game's folder until I found ones with text I recognized. I changed the value of XP that my monsters had, and suddenly, I was gaining levels liek crazy. This was one of the most awesome feelings,. I showed up to the battle with levels the game wasn't even suposed to let you reach and blew him totally out of the water.

One day, I was browsing the Minecraft forums, when I saw a post about an MCPE modification that added simple modding and scripting functionality to the game. It was called ModPE and it was just a simple tweak that could be downloaded with Cydia. Once installed, you could copy/paste the sourcecode for a mod. Forum users would post mods that could add things like World Edit, a Magic Carpet, and sometimes even new demensions or items. I didn't really understand how the mods worked, but I was certainly fascinated with the code. Changing certain values in the code and then testing them again would often net interesting results, or sometimes break the whole thing altogether. Although I wasn't really programming, I still felt like some kind of wizzard of code taking this game to the fringes of what was possible. These experiences lead me to persue a bit of actual programming. Back in the day, the official multiplayer for the game was limited to LAN, however there were some interesting developments. Someone created an app that would allow you to essentailly tunnel your connect to other users' networks and play LAN, and this was fun for awhile, but the server scene actually sprung up. Someone created a service called PocketMine Realms, which, through some dark magic with iOS certificates added a full page of servers to the game. This community was very underground niche when compared with the majority of people who played this game, so most of the folks on these servers also spent a decent ammount of work getting there. One night while perusing the Minecraft Forums, I saw an ad for a server hosting company offering a free PocketMine server (capped at a max of two players). I remember signing up for that so fast. That platform was my first experience with servers, and I learned all about using a terminal and control panel and manging the config files. PocketMine also had a plugin API, which I spent a lot of time playing with.

At the end of that year, my iPad broke completely, and I decided to get a cheap Kindle Fire, and just like with iOS, spent a ton of time online trying to figure out how to mod it. Fortunately, Android had a much more open platform back in the day, and instantly, I could get all kinds of mods and things for the device. The one I purchased (KFSOWI) remained pretty much unhackable for a very long time, however until I discovered a community for modding it that required a special "developer cable". Here, I was exposed to all manner of android whitchcraft. Rooting, custom roms, SuperSU, and lots of other interesting things. Android also had access to a few very interesting programs. There was Block Launcher, an app specifically for adding custom content to Minecraft. This had all kinds of juicy features, it even allowed you to debug a ModPE script right in the app. I learned through the warnings I'd get the the language I'd been programming in was Javascript.

A few months later, and I decided I should get an actual computer. I remember spending tons of time researching about all the different specs and parts, and how they would affect gaming. I chose a budget Acer laptop (Acer E1 572g-6648 (I have no idea why, but model numbers like that stick in my head forever)) with the highest specs for my budget. Not to be too dramatic here, but this purchase was a total snowball for my life. Initially, my parents tried to put restrictions in it where I had to get permission before installing anything, however, everything i wanted to do completely outpaced anything they knew about using computers and the restriction was promptly droped.
In a late night game of Team Fortress 2, I met an equally interesting and foul mouthed fellow named Jake. I was absolutely garbage at the game and I asked dumb questions in chat. He, however, was quite helpful and taught me how to play better. In one conversation with him, he told me he was a programmer, and instantly, I asked him to teach me about it and help get me started. He gave me programming books and taught me basic Java and C# through TeamViewer. For a long time, he was a good teacher, friend and and the perfect rubber ducky (for non-programmers, in programming culture, simply explaining your problems can be enough to lead you to a solution. Programmers will explain things aloud to another person or to an actual rubber ducky. See [Here](https://youtu.be/huOPVqztPdc)). I initially started learning Java to make Minecraft PC mods, however, I never got very far with this, especially considereding this is a relativelya advanced topic. As I progressed and learned more newer things, I became less interested in this. I can't remember many details of this, but I fondly remember hacking long into the night with the Eclipse editor, loads of YouTube tutorials, and a vauge idea of what I was doing. 

One of the most interesting projects I remember working on from those days was a program I called TrigFox. My eigth grade math class was learning all about triangles, specically the pythagorean theorm and basic trigonometric functions. Frustrated with pages of homework I would have to work through, I realized that solving these problems was a very simple, logical process. I decided to build out a simple command line java program to do it for me. This worked quite well, but I wanted something I could really show off to the class, and I knew I needed a GUI. Going from less than 50 lines of simople scanner and printline statements to a full-blown GUI was definitely a big challange, but I was all over it. Thenewboston's Tutorial series on the Java SWT library and Eclipse's window builder sent me on my path. I recall it being an uphill battle, and I had no idea how anything beneath the function calls and changing atributes actually worked. I was constantly haunted by the dreaded NullPointerExceptions and my code was probably disgusting, but I was creating exactly what I had envisioned. Eventually, I completed the project to a point where I was happy (though there were many UI issues like menus not disappearing when other menus that overlapped them were opened). I eagerly emailed my teacher a jar of the project and I was elated when I got to present my creation to the class, given that it could do every problem we threw at it. She even encouraged me to go beyond the class's lesson and improve the program by simplifying the radical rather than just giving a decimal. Later on, when I started learning about Android development, I decided to make an app version of this program. It was ultimately one of the proudest experiences of my younger self and encouraged me to keep improving and use what I'd learned to solve problems in new ways.

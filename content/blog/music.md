## Playing Music

I've always had an interest in creating music and even though I haven't actively persued it in many years (as of 2020_ it's still something burning a hole in the back of my brain.

My school, the Missisippi School for the Blind had mandatory daily music classes in elementary school as well as choir. Sometimes it was the typical singing, but often we'd get to try out new instruments and learn the music scale. I think the technical nature of this as well as the tactile play of the instruments really excited me, and ever since I've really liked the idea of playing music., The school also offered free paino lessons, which really got me going. I was never very good, but I always had a great time playing. 

What really propelled my interest for music, interestingly enough, was the video game The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time. the game featured a magical ocarnia that when played would have interesting effects on the world and characters. I remember getting really into the game and then asking my grandma to buy me a replica made by STL ocarina. 

Around this time I took a big interest in the types of instruments that can only play a single note at a time. The school offered band in sixth grade, which I took and was assigned to play the euphonium, a horn which was nearly my size at the time, which I did with great excitement. As I grew older and transferred schools, I switched to Saxaphone and enjoyed that much more. I actually purchased a cheap Sax to learn on myself for my birthday. However, middle and highschool bands grew much more serious, and my interest faded. My highschool had a "big band" with nearly 300 members, and many were hyper competitive. Since them, I haven't really gotten back into music, but I think I'd really like to again someday.

Today I can still play a few tunes on a piano, however, I struggle greatly with anything requiring a lot of dual-hand motion. I still have grand visions of getting a nice piano or saxaphone and really practicing it by myself nightly after work, and maybe playing with a small group on the swing nights at local clubs. The dream is still alive, and just maybe, I'll get back into it.

## Listening to music

The types of music I like have aslo beomce much more developed in more recent years. When I was a little kid, I never really knew how to answer the simple and very common question of "What kind of music do you like?" I never really had a solid answer.

My discovery of YouTube lead to greater refinement of my tastes, and I bet diving into my watch history would paint a clear picture of how my tastes evolved.

Today, my favorite genres are most definetly 

- Electroswing
- lofi/chill
- Rap
	But it has to be very political or of heavy subject matter, and not portray a strictly oppulent lifetyle for me to enjoy it
- Showtunes?
	I get really into music from anime, cartoons, or video games. I don't know the name of this genre, so I'm going to call it show tunes because it's comprised of, get this, toons, from a show!

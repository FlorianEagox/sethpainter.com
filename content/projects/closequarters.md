This was a game created in a single weekend, 48 hours, with my friends [Aidan Lovelace](https://aidanlovelace.com") and Kenny Pratt.

## Plot:

Oh No! Your pirate ship is sinking!!! Get what you can and get out, NOW!

In this game, you play as a pirate traversing the dark decks of his sinking ship, trying to collect as many trinkets as possible. Once collected, trinkets must be taken to the upper deck and stowed away. But watch out! Water is creeping in and slowly destroying your ship. Get what you can, while you can. Your score is determined by how much you managed to save.

The project was built with the Processing Java library and the art was done in Krita

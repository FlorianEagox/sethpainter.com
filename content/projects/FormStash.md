Quickly stash the contents of HTML forms and reload them later.

This chrome extension allows you to quickly stash away the contents of forms you're working on and fill them back later. If you're filling out a long application with no way to save for later, this is for you. You can create multiple stashes for each page, and you can even have the extension automatically update the form data as you type it. All data is seamlessly synced between chrome on all of your devices!
 
The extension is open-source, written with vinalla HTML, CSS, and javascript. It's currently available only for Chrome, but will be comming to FireFox and Edge soon along with synced data support.

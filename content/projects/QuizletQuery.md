This project is effectively an API for quizlet. You can search a question, often a very specific one, and it will return a readable result from quizlet. You could use it for any kind of school work, or to extend an instant answers platform to deliver more specific information.

It's written with Python and makes use of Google Custom Search to find relevant flashcard sets and Requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape the answers from Quizlet pages. The results are delivered with a Flask server.

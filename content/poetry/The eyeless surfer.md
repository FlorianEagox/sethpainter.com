title: The Eyeless Surfer
---

You wish you had my wisdom 
But you would melt if you was saddled by my woes 
Y'all seem to coast on windy breezes of the waves of life
But we are ripped up by the riptides that come and never go
But regardless you won't catch me bound up in the sunshine

Because every dusk I slip into the deserted whipping ponds and flounder in the bouncing shallow
Cling to it until I center the balance and sway with the winds of the earth
Yes I find a way to explode my flinching muscles to match the world, absorbing me as we waltz
Practice until I can conceal my faults

Then in daylight you wouldn't believe the dancing surfer's true identity 
Watching them joust in the deep, clowning and glistening perrying tsunamis 
Neither flow like they know the meaning of the word surface tension 
Let alone how to break it 
Flowing like they throwing it back
Wobbling weightlessly so probably woelessly
Wrong 
You couldn't feel the gravity with the way you've concieved our worth up in your worldview

[Beat switch]
Because we slip away into slithering parts that are rarely seen peaking past the margins
We walk between walls the way our presence mimics or novelty
I'm creeping through crevices slipping with friction through this reality
When you catch a glimpse you probably tell your friends
Because every time you see me fall we all fall deeper in the hole 
And yet our blighted eyes are somehow coefficient to the full strides we dare to tred
Fucked up how you remember us as the people we appeared to be rather than the amazing things we did

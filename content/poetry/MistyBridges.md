Muddy is the ocean of unnamed Numbers
And so to must muddy be my boots stomping and clonking, nudging and trudging along
A glassy, hazy malaise
An unmistakable drowning haze
Still is the sway of the cracking trusses
Winged silhouettes penetrate the thick hemisphere
Am I living life? Crossing the Misty Bridge
So much ground to cover
So much world to sunder
Legions call out from the city
Danging Postage adorns its rusty fences
Warning Journeymen they've already come too far
Perhaps I could've clung on harder
Other charlatans accompany this
Their faces sullen and numb
Sticks scraping splintered nails
Hard to keep dreaming when the rivers fog
Obscures picturesque visions of the harbor beyond
Lurk wearily leery of the weak and lost that will feed and prey on your stride
The timbers splinter and swept away are those unfulfilled in the current
Crunching to canes and crutches and whining under wheels, weak are those abandoned trusses
Crying out are the forgotten masses cringing fraying ropes sidling towards exodus
Perhaps the fog will never clear, I'll continue to shed a tear and I simply have no place here.
Off I dream to go, into the rivers flow, no one would know, quiet and violent and thrashing and smashing my head against rocks just because I couldn't afford to move another board 
But the tear condenses freezing me to my senses back to reality and what's in front of me.
Just as the river claimed its place on the face of this uncaring marble,
to must I pry and gnaw and hammer and nail and see and saw for the people without the gumption or stripped of their function, trapped at this junction
forced to languish crying out in anguish to cross this chasm
and break free
of the liminality
...
Whispy and wicked are their cries in the dew
Through the beams they sublimate
Piercing in my nose and screaming in my ears
Scrambling my brain but calming my fears
Another muddy mile passed, so many remain
One foot proceeding the other
I have no time for the calls I've left behind

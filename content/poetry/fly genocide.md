I overslept and my dog shit on the floor 
Took out the trash and a fly slip through the door
He's ransacking my house making me crazy 
Can't go nowhere without hearing flight of the bumblebee buzzing in front of me 
Should have been keeping my house clean 
When I went back to sleep that fly had a feast munching on feces
Waking up wondering what drugs I took cause I'm seeing double 
The circle of life multiples before my very eyes
And I'm feeling shook man I think I'm in trouble
Life, I know I should be respecting it
Shoulda smacked that fat eggsack I ain't protecting it
But now I'm balling out 
Call me Stalin the way I'm spraying the raid, agent orange and leaded gas imma let it rain
The population is growing, I'll turn this place into a war zone so I can shrink it 
My poison my water supply if I thought I could drink it
Now I'm war mongering like Alexander
Shedding blood with every step
Trudging on with slanderous canter 
Stomping on innocent roaches just for the hell of it
I went on this journey 
Causing harm and breaking up families 
All because I couldn't set my alarm and wake up early

title: Atlas Breakdanced
---

Every time I tried to blast off I felt it rattle me
My craft stretching dotted parallel lines across the mental horizon
I was quickly reminded what I had hid inside had come to bide me
Ride me tightly its igniting drive whipped at my nerves twitched for me dancing phalanges
Melodies crashed at me leaving the hastening mental wasteland, vast, hoards of boars and buffalo set in an orchestra

Their wild arhymic beating pounding my mental ear, ear-drumming like a bumbling tympani
Each gust of wind a vortex of atonal chorus a board of schromgus  
Ever plentiful, overcrowding its overflowing host with the ghosts of dissonant interval notes
shrieking souls leading voices to their aimless melody

Wild hallucinations for those ancient sapiens or distant aliens 
This thickening pounding mental cacophony was perhaps the command of a calling God
The call of Apollo, leaving my voice mail ringing to let me know I was neglecting quota

Chants of the ancient evolving Australopithecus dancing by the first fire
I was taking hints listening closer, tuned into the frequencies breaching me 
Like Pythagoras diving into theorems dividing that doubling unison
Scaling the mountains of questions
Of placement and arangement as I began to grip lucid of this fountianous universe
I sensed a glimer, a rhythmic center but I was tasked with the mass
I was the Atlas

Each passing day I found myself dedicated to the training
Motivated by the waiting chaos of the singing of the great beyond
The messages meshing with the actual, the rational, egotistical reasonable 
Absorbing this nonsense into its methodical process
Turning mush into sonatas of virtue
Language languishing as the two sides clash to compute

What can be described becomes imbibed in the vibe
The boars march like soldiers as they trance across the rolling landscapes
This imagined universe flows and ebbs in every scale you can meter
The buffaloing buffalo pery ringing blows as swords chime in time with the way they make him feel
This atonal mush growing into a sculpture
Vultures skid graceful on the gentle waves of energy passing through the shrinking abyss

But still Atlas shrugs and must strain to tame the chromatic slop, mine for greater gleams
force its dendrites to retain the biases, force itself to find a place to bind receptors from different centers
Analyze with perfect certainty everything it finds to fly so beautifully
Forcefully dephile old notions

Atlas must whip ocean waves crashing on the eroding lands
His hands gesticulating wildly 
Break Dancing to the beat of his thundering boom boxing
Sending gusts across the dust

His brain a train station for inflating receptors as those
dendrites strike hot guiding tracks
Each echoing things he learns from the universe
or what he sees on earth
Life lives and dies with the turntable scratch 
Only when he knows his purpos, he can balance so easily as he breakdances to the beats of striking quarks on a universal scale
his wild eyes light up his face and the skies gloom and brighten when he blinks 
Finally he takes the Earth and sends it dribbling
Cosmic energy flowing as it clashes past fragments of the galaxy
He has ascended. There's nothing demi about this God


The gods too vibe with his funky flow, irading the cosmic backgrounds as that boy gets down
It's crazy because Ares jealous by the way Athena twerking with Aphrodite On Zues who suddenly shooting lightning at the planet!
And you know Atlas had to clap back with that distrack! 
And the opps is watching because Artimis pulls her bow back 
You don't wanna see what happens when these cats get to fighting over scraps the Titans told them to box for

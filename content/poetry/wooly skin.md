Go head and just judge me
Bang the gavel 
Take this thread, walk away, let it all unravel 
It meant nothing to anyone but me

I'm holding the tension 
As I struggle to mention those three little words
So I'll take my feelings
And burry them deep beneath the stuffing
Weave them in the every stitch
I bound up my hands for you
Walked thousands of yards on my fingertips 

I made it in your image
Its wooly skin echoes your soul

I toiled countless hours
Spent so many nights by the fire
For a future that could've been hours
All for something to which I'll never aspire

Each loop a thought I couldn't say Each knot a promise gave away
But you thanked me like it was nothing at all While stood there, waiting for your calI

So just take it, take it, and leave me alone 
I sent it out into the world just so I could let you go

So set it and leave it
Let the dust begin to settle
On that long forgotten trinket 
But when someone stumbles with curiosity
I hope your thoughts begin to jumble and you can't help but think of me
Feel the lump in your throat swell

Hold it close like it's never enough
cause I'm gone!

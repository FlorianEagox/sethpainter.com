title: What happened?
---

Held up in this cage of glass
Watching as the seasons pass
Wondering how long this can last, awwoo

Counting clockticks on the wall
Endless lists I start to scrawl
Distracted by the ending of it all...

Tell me what has happened to my hood
stranger neighbors never learn their names
Poisoned grass and asphalt mountains
Endless trash and no more children
Is this City 17?

But I'll still take the dog we'll walk the block
Sing our silly songs, because this world is beautiful

Tell me what the fuck has happened to this City
Blue flutters blare through my darkened shutters
Paved a new lane, ripped up the trains
Left us all fending in the gutters

But we will fight make this town our paradise
Tug of war to the bitter end these bastard parasites

And what the fuck has happened to this earth
This world has gone so insane we walk around with plastic brains
Had all the answers let them lie All so we could bleed her dry
Nothing will ever be the same I can't look back or I'm gonna cry

Won't look out the window to watch the falling pieces
Ignore the tornado sirens flashing on my screens
Looking forward never where we're going. Only growing 
Just hold my hands we'll build it back. we have to try

title: Cheating in TF2 Sonnet
---

Trapped back in that same place
Held back by my broken neural solder traces
I do the only thing I know how to
Hacked into the mainframe
Wired directly into my brain
I spawned a glitched entity
So I had to change the game you see
Forced my oppressor to glow with the light of a thousand suns
Fighting one lowly blind lion
You heared the thundering roars of my minigun
Gibbing everyone, Walking passed dressed in blue but painted red
Put my name up on that leaderboard swearing screaming in the chat they said
"Go back to the wheelchair league you faggot cheater"
So I bit the Sandvich ripped out my boxing gloves
Gave that Scout a bear-hug
Because your the hare and I'm the tortoise
Forcing my way in this world from streets to Team Fortress
But you never heard the that tale told by Puskin or Dostoevsky
Because while the flashy hare was napping
That hungry turtle got to snapping
Clapping Natasha bring the heat gushing rivers wetting the sandy Badlands
I had to kick like Kazotsky
When I taunt he had to leave the game
Made me the team Captain despite my handicapping, screaming my name!
I can't aim but I smell blood, so they ought to Hale me Saxton

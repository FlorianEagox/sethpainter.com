title: Love Like the Movies, But Not for Me
---

Well yes I must confess I want to love like I've seen in all these movies
Cause I been peeping, fucked up how they got me dreaming 
Looking for my true pookie
She hot and she spicy 
Then she could and she icy 
She seeing what I don't see even with her eyes shut 
But she don't even got to be a she
Introducing me to new ways of living life by my gut

All the drive in the world they tryna ride our stide
We balancing holding in unison on that tandem bike of life
Hoes on either side we invite em over for cavier and pie then we yiffing in pile 
Take turns spitting verses singing balads bout how we lift each other's curses
And god forbid I ever meat her and she reads this pathetic tattered sonnet
But if she was the one, she'd have to clap back with an even hotter disstrack of a love letter

Call me the Dean with the cookies for the love cause
I want that Gilmore Girl who can light the room like candles with just a smile
But then she talking and she shining more brilliant than the sun
She read every book on my shelf then tore apart every one
I'll be jackson and you can be cooky just like Suki and I'll have your back like Luke
Shit we could even thrive on being insufferable Like Richard and Emily we be so rich it makes you die
Cause we drowning in that smooth butter, way we ride every type of vibe
I'm desperate I won't lie, for someone starry Eyed Like Lorelei

Need to hurry up and meet my Giselle Saint Claire
Wanna sneak out with Slipping Kimmy they can't catch this pair
Where's the Black to my Pink like Marceline, eating buys for lunch
I'm the fucking Vampire queen, but my P.B. in love is like 8 months
Cause I'm weak and blind, but I got that clairvoyant eye
 So even if you stupid and brawny like a Ruby
We could fuse a Garnet
No more Lapis and Jasper
I'm ready for the Lapis to my Peridot
  
I want her to get all up inside me
Especially in my brain
Doing sick trick show me how her clock ticks
Man I wanna be so insane thinking bout all the cool things she did.
I'm getting sadder felling that loving in the air but I'm not catching wind
Because I'm just Dipper and all these dream girls is Windy
And here I am boy-crazy like Mable these all dreams, only fables



So tonight you better hold me closer Tiny Dancer
Because by the time I awake She done danced right out my bed
It all got me in my feels singing dreaming up late something Just Like Chet
So many songs of love they put up on my TV screen
But not for me 
So many lasses come to pass
But love lasts only so many days 
The meaning of her kiss can't be dismissed 
It never seems to fade 
But I guess she's not for me, because I want a love like I've seen in the movies

And I be just like Carrie writing bout all the dark places where love don't grow
sleeping around with all these wacky weirdos 
I'm getting serious like Charlotte 
Don't care if she's a harlot because I crave a panther like Samantha 
Go getter who gon elevate ya
I'll be the Che to your Miranda cause all my homies hate Steve
Get you twisting up your whole world view, like you acting someone new

But alas all this pathetic mass I write can stay while these shortening seasons pass
Cause I got love to give and learn to love myself more each passing day 
I'll follow my dreams and hope that lucky lass gone tumble through my way

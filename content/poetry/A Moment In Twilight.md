A Moment in Twilight:

Every journey must pause
A mourning moment for the day we've lost  
We stare back, shift gazes to the days that made us 
Staring longingly at how long we last mapped a lap 
Lulling on as the sun drifts between clouds, sweat cools softened brows

Standing tall on mountains we remember climbing 
See ourselves reflected even in distant ponds children once mucked through 
Or perhaps in the skies, peaking our eyes past horizons mystified by virtues we once knew
 
Rest our aching trembling limbs and ask ourselves if we'd dare to walk again 
Deep, safe in winding valley vistas 
Or catching our hastening breath from altitudes 
Only moments of respite from what might loom, that which once chased us

Muscles bulge or sag
From days that that race or drag 
A  forged path to learn or forget
Carving only footsteps to be remembered
Crusted mud covers tussled scars 
In these reflections we are Frozen, as we are
To question weather tired eyes resembled where we thought we were going 
Take respite, indulge our vices
Would we recognize the plucky plunderer first awakening from slumber
Taken under by sacrificing conundrums

Have we shaken the hum-drumming
Escaped the buzzing, still left running from it?
Satisfied by the accumulated paces 
Dismal, discontented, with the abysmal distance we have barely begun to graze?
Proud to have dodged barrages of marauding mirages
Counting souvenir blessings
Settled campfires draped by kindled dressings 
Taking refuge from leering fears 
Averting gazes from the leering smoke stoked by dancing embers

Will we come to know ourselves tomorrow
Or pretend through weeks of deluded cloudy views 
Lonely with only our minds as guides 
Grateful for quiet peace of mind 
Proud or humbled 
By how we skated or stumbled
Gloating gains or cursing fumbles 
Can we rest or must morning bring more tests
Gentle winds begging questions only answered in the faded constellations 
But for now in final conscious moments can we be washed over by oceans of quiet contemplation

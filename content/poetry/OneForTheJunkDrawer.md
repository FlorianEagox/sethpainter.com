title: One for the Junk Drawer

A tribute, a token, for my inspiration
A thank-you, a trinket, stolen compensation
A contract, a challenge with sporadic information
Nothing special, pretentiously utilitarian....
Vaguely proletarian, irresistibly...
Slovenly commodity, not bought by me
Oh so Maliciously snagged
Drying my sopping heart in rags
Quietly captured, the fluttering enraptured
A reason to rendezvous 
Perhaps to give it back to you
Wistfully romantic, yet shockingly pragmatic
Perhaps an indication, a commonality
A reminder of what can never be
Even still...

Boldly inscribing, Affirmative conformation
Sparks lit, an artificial flame, Tricking my brain. Divination beholdend
Its lusterous angles and weighty abbrasions

Just another lame guy, A nice try, a mocking echo of my cries
Let it be forgotten, cast into the bottom
deep in the drawers where projects go to die 
and I lose scraps of forgotten fodder
Why even bother?
A meager misplacable mechanism sold and
routinely, predictably profane, yet I apologetically harbor no disdain

Nickels at my fingertips, brass in the air
Free of charge, fickle, I'll pretend to care!
Gillespie's Tunisia electric euphoria
Expressly messy, Panacea.
Melodic fields of the ferrous magnet's flow. I'm Dizzy
Slashing discernlessly at wheat and chaff 
If only I could preserve that arc, capture that spark, and open the world's ears to my bark!
Perhaps it's all just silly
Mass produced, remarkably obtuse, invitations to try
And I had it all in me the whole time

title: Hail to the Clown
---

She's the dancing freak shining like a streak on the surface
A fool that escaped from the pound, running with an undefinable purpose
Goes out, barks loud, in an animal mask but its worse cause it's not cause she's nervous

The clown drowning in torrential deluges of broken dreams
Jaw-jacking petty crowds, on lookers, no purpose
All suckers, don't  even know they in the circus
Deluded how that jester sweating to the seams, perspiration

You can try to pin it down but truly its nothing you've seen before
Even when it stares into your soul you still see more
Kicking wildly, posed by wicked forces
They come to rest and call it inspiration

Something profound but never remembered
 Every answer don't stop leaving you with more questions 
A cryptid, can't miss it waited to be hunted witch forks and torches
And when they slip the mask off the jaw drops, dead, gorgeous

Every season it's the same reason they short on the deliverable
If you was fighting this battle you'd probably call yourself miserable
The way they tame weaves or spit heat, you think it's a game
You've been beat left in the dustbowl, creative drought, so barren
And he on the next point like a scout leave you staring

Whispers fly by while the silent gazes stimulating waves of fear
You could turn tail and run
Choose to stay and have fun, inhale the tryptamines they breath
With those piercing eyes biting tusks and neon tongue

On a mission to be the best big brother, done
Now glistening with the triforce of wisdom like the sis you never had. Done
What's the next one, something in between?
The middle sibling never spitting straight syllogisms
Slipping harder than all of y'all and still never taking falls 

Honking loud through the quiet Ikana valley with the Deku pipes
No time to drown cause the clowns got more masks to make
Adults looking down but then they beg for advice
The childish one making all the kids look up to the joker

Vicious, truly a heathen...
Rolling the streets like Stevie from Downtown to Motown
Meaner than Stink-Meaner, Way she wields the cane like a blade
Play with the pray run it back once more!
Plap plap plap, the last sound you hear before they fade to vore

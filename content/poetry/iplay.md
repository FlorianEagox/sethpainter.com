I play to ward the world
Poised behind the glass
I play to calm myself 
Stand still in all its mass 

When I play I carve out the domain
Send rattles through unsuspecting shelves
Force the world to resonate
Be it knocking thuds or whwisling bells

Worldly woes can’t be counted on
Can mever trust them to follow through 
But if I play tonight and pray a hallowed song
Tomorrows lone dawning promise is surely true

I’ll mold myself, an aspring contender
Donate my flesh, reborn anew
My lungs will swell, these tortured hands surrender
For when I play I lose myself, but hope to find the truth

I play to let the shattered patterns in my brain take possession
Let wicked strings dance for me my chattering skeleton 
Caress the world with my internal confessions 
Until I've played so much I cannot play again

I shout to the air I must announce 
Like a dog with its howling cries
To bind the knots that once confound
I play to  strip the tears streaming from your eyes

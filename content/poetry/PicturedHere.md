A grave of identities waiting in purgatory
passed on the torch for someone new to carry the story 
Looking back at the past it glares back at me
I gaze in the mirror and I cannot unsee 
He who once was, preconceptualized 
Socially under audit, caged but not ranged
I can't believe I'd ever bought it

But there he is standing right in front of me
A familiar, but disparate entity
Trapped like wax stuck in their unwavering connotations 
Dead ends, withering vines frozen in stagnation
Petrified, depersonalized, staring back, but lacking eyes 

Calloused unfeeling, out of sync with the way the world was breathing
Always being told it was wrong for trusting its feelings 
Scared to be bold and lacking its footing
Like an ape before uttering its first annunciation

So when it peers back looking in the mirror glass
I stiffen aghast stuck in those once trodden tracks
at what I've once seen but since forgotten
I'll stuff it back down deep in its closet coffin
Lest it ever rears its ugly head, or should I hear it's ugly name be said

Perhaps it's all just a guffawing collusion 
I can't kill what has died because I'm truly a fusion
Not reborn but reforged
Smelted in a transmuting flame
Drawing on our healing pain
Built anew atop an ugly frame
Or maybe the ugliness was like an ore's suffocating gangue
Shining bright once chipped and burned away
Moved, melting itself violently into motion
Bettered, unfettered from its shackling bedrock ocean

In any case I wanna punch his stupid fucking face
Say goodbye, let it leave no trace
Gloat about how I was always right, bearing down with our all might
Revenge on everyone who ever tried to dissuade
Force my hand back across the mirror surface 
Treating the real me like a phase to be erased
Sealed and filed, returned to their worthless empty embrace

Maybe one day I'll learn to love it all
Or at the very least to reconcile
Stare fondly at the dusty candid frames on the walls
Even if the puzzle pieces still lay jumbled in a pile

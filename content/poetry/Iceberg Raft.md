title: Iceberg Raft
---

I'm vibing riding on high over the coast line
Bobbing linearly, counting peaks something like a number line
Hoping that the coast stays clear
I can sense my ghost is near but still I feel no kind of fear
Beginning to think I like it here

I'm boasting I'm gloating 
Gliding on my coattails 
I passed one test but my laurels are rested

Soon the ride slips and it's back to jogging the unending slog on the hedonic treadmill
The flying high resides with the receding high tide as brightening skies hide away the moonlight
The derivative dips and it was only relatively impressive in the relative sense
Only locally, a local minimum but low-key lowly compared to it globally

Sun will start to rot the husk that feeds the feasting buzzards and
Once what was wet grows rust
I have to assume my days are numbered 
Floating on a melting iceberg 
Hot and wet and shivering under the burning Sun
Yet I'm still singing, impressing the air compressing it's galeing frequencies with each choked note in from my frosty throat
Left home with no calculator but I'll construct an abacus out of snowballs
I'll scrawl equations with an icicle drawing on the snowfall

Integrating the feigning waing, dry unraining contributions is fruitless
Enumerating stutters like it's tasked with paradoxically computing a super task for Banachâ€“Tarski. Or put in other words like a Taylor Series, asymtotic
That is to say it leaves you with diminishing returns, fails to measure
Emotionally hopeless only knowing contentness, never pleasure
Even combinatorically trying each island leaves me crying stoic freezing tears feeling like I've been scratching at mear fractions of this vast wet uncharted desert wetland

Why have I chosen to wade hopelessly lonely strapped to a raft in the ocean 
Maybe I'm petrified by the prospect of progress and the turbulent haze of exerting the weight needed to churn the phasing waves
A proposition too pricey to move these soggy limbs and sway the foggy mental malaise
But without guest or propulsion, I'm hooked on that notion 

Or even more fearing the dawning bronze delicately dotting on those distant shorline fronze?

Maybe only four points on the compass rose
yet so many more unknown peering past the shore behind the horizon line
Radially infinite in a wider sense
Too wide to feel with my minds eye
Even when viewed under the lense of preciser approximations of pi

I can explain it descretly but only in the abstract
To see it concretely would be to comprehend the true vast scale of God
Maybe something I once knew but have since forgot
Something I have yet to do with my mear mathematical proofs

But I'll keep applying the theorems and trying the lemas
Because in this liminal abyss all I know is dissociating
All my mind can do is race and pin me down with contemplating quotients of these delightful dilemmas 
So paralyzed like wood I'm stifly drifting
Not so swiftly by like a castigated castaway

Listen close and might you hear a blip of my patterned babbling
Echo through your sagging sails
Just before it fades away within the wind
Something like a siren song
and then you are trapped too
too doomed to break the cycles of questions there are no answers to

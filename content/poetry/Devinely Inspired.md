I made a trade with God 
Took a swig of that Bluey Vuitton 
Sipping on that childish wisdom
Grounded up with lemons I was making fancy tea 
Had to get the ritual just right 
Drink it out the crystal glass
Made a change like Santiago to chase that personal legend or so spoke the old man in my dreams
I was the Alchemist, a Shepard straying from the flock, transmuting my future, giving it all up

But after a while I was cursing at the pentagrams and candelabras 
Felt like I had been betrayed by the shamans 
Cuz all I felt was nauseous for hours 
And then it finally happened I laid down to kick back
Watch some Harry Mack hope this belly bug would pass 
And dog I was tripping fucking balls harder than I ever had before.
Tunneling through psychedelic Bliss like a fourth dimensional alien 
I close my eyes and then I find myself slipping between different rooms from different realities witnessing
Divine typography present itself but it was hardly salient.

I climbed out the bed making sure I was still alive hadn't succumb to the ego dead
I had malted off my old skin and only patches of my former self remained 
Had reached a mycological medium in my microbiome again 
And then I was handed the keys to the spaceship 
I was taking control

While I was washing away all my inhibitions and that dirty bathtub 
For the first time in my life I was the firest MC rocking the fucking club 
I started to take notice of how the steam evaporated straight in the moment
Soap washed right off the walls slipped away into the drain 
Trees fall alone in the forest
Suddenly these notions started harmonizing in my brain

Because I was freestyleing and them bars was just like dust within the wind
I made mistakes but they evaporated just as fast as the mist right after
I was slipping in the shower but I was never falling 
Hitting sequences with the rhythm in time like the water clashed with the alabaster
For the first time I was feeling alive in a way I never had 
Looked down at my body and I could see glowing veins running up my arms 
Pulsating illuminated by synapses every time I kick a bar 

Don't remember what I was talking about but I'm sure if I listen back that it was total ass 
But that's okay because nobody remembers the first rock that caused the damn to collapse
I felt like God had changed his mind about the deal, but he doubled the price 
Because staring at the paintings freshly drying on my glowing wet skin 
Echoed the patterns I knew but only now understand 
Yes I was the main attraction, headlining in heaven's highest tower 
I just prayed I wasn't possessed,
Donating my vessel only to have my heart ripped back out my chest.
But it was truly meant to be because that was just the catalyst 

That transcendental moment yapped about by Jung, Witman and Emerson  
Where I began to show myself that God was always me
